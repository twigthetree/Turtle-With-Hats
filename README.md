This is a place for you to start building your Collection Style Game Project!

- Include a catcher sprite that moves left and right when the arrow keys are pressed. 
- Detect collision when the falling object collides with the catcher.

- Increase the score when the falling object collides with the catcher.
- Optional:
  - Include three images: one in the background, one for your catcher sprite, and one for your falling object sprite.
  - Include citations for your images in your project’s README file. 

### Optional Spice Level + Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Trying a Spice Level Challenge (See Part 5)

## File Overview

### ← script.js

This is where we will add the JavaScript code for our game.

### ← assets

Drag in assets, like images, to add them to your project. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg` or `assets/example.png`.

### ← index.html

The HTML file contains HTML code that sets up a webpage for our game. We also add libraries in this file using HTML tags.

### ← README.md

That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what your game does and how you built it. 

### ← style.css

The CSS file adds styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. We will not use this file for our game and instead update the style of our game in the script.js file.
